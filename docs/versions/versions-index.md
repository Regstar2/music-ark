v0.5 identity, v0.5.1 Variant, v0.6 Coverage and v0.7 Download remain authoritative independent layers. v0.8 does not replace them: it creates an immutable preview and safely coordinates only current supported operations, primarily `missing + wanted → DownloadService.enqueue()` after confirmation and revalidation.

No new large product slice is committed after v0.8; the next version is intentionally **TBD / stabilization** until there is a concrete need.
